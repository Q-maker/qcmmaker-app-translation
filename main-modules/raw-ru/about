<b>What is a *.qcm file?</b>
<br/>
â€¢Qcm file is file format that aims to supports interactive quizzes including pictures & sounds with automatic scoring.
<br/>
â€¢A Qcm file is a compressed file that contains a set of questions, proposals, and answers.
<br/>
â€¢The structure of the files *.qcm makes it possible to embark among others multimedia contents such as images and sounds.
<br/>
â€¢Each *.qcm file is structured so that it is interpreted automatically by any compatible application.
</p>
<br/>
<b>Therefore;</b> Once you share a quiz as portable and shareable <b>QCM file format</b>, the receiver needs to have $appname app installed or at least a compatible QCM file reader in order to read and play it.
Indeed, QCM file format is like any other file format, it needs a compatible reader to be read and interpreted.
<br/>
For example same as you need MSWord to read DOC file, MSExcel for XLS file or even a PDF reader to read a PDF file, you also need a QCM file reader to read QCM file format as does <b>this app</b> and all apps compatible with the Q-maker technology.
<br/>

<p>
<br/>
<p>
<b>Thus,</b> the $appname app allows you to read, create, edit, share, list and manage all quiz files available on your device storage disk. It offers you simple and easy methods to play, edit and modify received or own created quizzes available as <b>QCM</b> files directly from your device storage disk.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Indeed,</b> while editing, quiz files created through this app remain private inside your storage disk and are never copied anywhere even not on our own Web-server until or unless you decide <b>on your own</b> to share these quizzes to a third party as simple portable and shareable <b>QCM</b> files.
</p>
